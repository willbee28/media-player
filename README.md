# Linear Media Player

Hey, thanks for taking the time to work on this exercise. We're excited to see what you come up with â€“
the goal is to create an audio player for playing a predefined playlist of audio files. Think of it
like a stripped-down version of Spotify or the classic Winamp.

### Getting started

You can use `npm` to install the dependencies and run the basic React project. Feel free to add any additional libraries 
or frameworks you need.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Playlist data

The playlist data is stored in `src/data/playlists.json`. It includes a list of audio files and some associated metadata,
you can import the json file directly with no need for network requests.
